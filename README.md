# Getting Started

In order to run this application on an Android device or emulator, complete the following steps.

**NOTE:** A production version of this application will soon be available on the Google Play Store.
Thus, the below steps would not be required if you wanted to only view the application's behavior. 

## Authentication
Initiating live video and audio communication requires a proper access token from a valid Twilio account.
Perform the following to authenticate with Twilio successfully:

1. Ensure you are using the community build variant.
