## Getting Started

In order to run this application on an Android device or emulator, complete the following steps.

### Deploy Twilio Access Token Server

**NOTE:** The Twilio Function that provides access tokens via a passcode should *NOT* be used in a production environment. This token server supports seamlessly getting started with the collaboration app, and while convenient, the passcode is not secure enough for production environments. You should use an authentication provider to securely provide access tokens to your client applications. You can find more information about Programmable Video access tokens [in this tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/user-identity-access-tokens).

The app requires a back-end to generate [Twilio access tokens](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/tutorials/user-identity-access-tokens). Follow the instructions below to deploy a serverless back-end using [Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions).

1. [Install Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart).
1. Run `twilio login` and follow prompts to [login to your Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart#login-to-your-twilio-account).
1. Run `twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-rtc`.
1. Run `twilio rtc:apps:video:deploy --authentication passcode`.
1. The passcode that is output will be used later to [sign in to the app](#start-video-conference).

The passcode will expire after one week. To generate a new passcode, run `twilio rtc:apps:video:deploy --authentication passcode --override`.

#### Troubleshooting The Twilio CLI

If any errors occur after running a [Twilio CLI RTC Plugin](https://github.com/twilio-labs/plugin-rtc) command, then try the following steps.

1. Run `twilio plugins:update` to update the rtc plugin to the latest version.
1. Run `twilio rtc:apps:video:delete` to delete any existing authentication servers.
1. Run `twilio rtc:apps:video:deploy --authentication passcode` to deploy a new authentication server.

### Build

Currently there are three product flavors for the application.

1. Internal - The application intended for internal testing and QA at Twilio. _This variant can only be built by Twilions._
2. Twilio - The application intended for every day use at Twilio. _This variant can only be built by Twilions._
3. Community - The application intended for developers interested in using Programmable Video. _This variant can be built by all developers._
   1. debug and release build types are supported.

#### Building the Community Flavor

The community flavor of the application is meant for developers who would like to work with the Video Android SDK in the context of a full-fledged application.

To get started with the community flavor follow these steps:

1. Select the `communityDebug` Build Variant.
1. Run the application.

### Start Video Conference

For each device:

1. [Run](#building-the-community-flavor) the app.
1. Enter any unique name in the `Your name` field.
1. Enter the passcode from [Deploy Twilio Access Token Server](#deploy-twilio-access-token-server) in the `Passcode` field.
1. Tap `Log in`.
1. Enter a room name.
1. Tap `Join`.

The passcode will expire after one week. Follow the steps below to sign in with a new passcode.

1. [Generate a new passcode](#deploy-twilio-access-token-server).
1. In the app tap `Settings > Sign Out`.
1. Repeat the [steps above](#start-video-conference).
